But can you also build web sites that are usable by machines? That's where the future lies, and that's what RESTful Web Services shows you how to do. The World Wide Web is the most popular distributed application in history, and Web services and mashups have turned it into a powerful distributed computing platform. But today's web service technologies have lost sight of the simplicity that made the Web successful. They don't work like the Web, and they're missing out on its advantages. This book puts the "Web" back into web services. It shows how you can connect to the programmable web with the technologies you already use every day. The key is REST, the architectural style that drives the Web. This book: Emphasizes the power of basic Web technologies -- the HTTP application protocol, the URI naming standard, and the XML markup language Introduces the Resource-Oriented Architecture (ROA), a common-sense set of rules for designing RESTful web services Shows how a RESTful design is simpler, more versatile, and more scalable than a design based on Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) Includes real-world examples of RESTful web services, like Amazon's Simple Storage Service and the Atom Publishing Protocol Discusses web service clients for popular programming languages Shows how to implement RESTful services in three popular frameworks -- Ruby on Rails, Restlet (for Java), and Django (for Python) Focuses on practical issues: how to design and implement RESTful web services and clients This is the first book that applies the REST design philosophy to real web services. It sets down the best practices you need to make your design a success, and the techniques you need to turn your design into working code. You can harness the power of the Web for programmable applications: you just have to work with the Web instead of against it. This book shows you how.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780596554606"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0596554605"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":454,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Computers"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":42,"contentVersion":"0.2.1.0.preview.3","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://bks5.books.google.co.uk/books?id=XUaErakHsoAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://bks5.books.google.co.uk/books?id=XUaErakHsoAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XUaErakHsoAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=RESTful&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XUaErakHsoAC&dq=RESTful&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/RESTful_Web_Services.html?hl=&id=XUaErakHsoAC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"GB","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"GB","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true},"webReaderLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books/reader?id=XUaErakHsoAC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"This book: Emphasizes the power of basic Web technologies -- the HTTP application protocol, the URI naming standard, and the XML markup language Introduces the Resource-Oriented Architecture (ROA), a common-sense set of rules for designing ..."}},"1":{"kind":"books#volume","id":"_jQtCL5_vAcC","etag":"Z989JC1KHHU","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/_jQtCL5_vAcC","volumeInfo":{"title":"RESTful Java with JAX-RS","authors":["Bill Burke"],"publisher":""O'Reilly Media, Inc."","publishedDate":"2009-11-10","description":"Learn how to design and develop distributed web services in Java using RESTful architectural principals and the JAX-RS specification in Java EE 6.

Written by Windows Communication Foundation (WFC) expert Jon Flanders, this hands-on tutorial demonstrates how you can use WCF and other components of the .NET 3.5 Framework to build, deploy and use REST-based web services in a variety of application scenarios. RESTful architecture offers a simpler approach to building web services than SOAP, SOA, and the cumbersome WS- stack. And WCF has proven to be a flexible technology for building distributed systems not necessarily tied to WS- standards. RESTful .NET provides you with a complete guide to the WCF REST programming model for building web services consumed either by machines or humans. You'll learn how to: Program Read-Only (GET) services Program READ/WRITE services Host REST services Program REST feeds Program AJAX REST clients Secure REST endpoints Use workflow to deliver REST services Consume RESTful XML services using WCF Work with HTTP Work with ADO.NET Data Services (Astoria) RESTful .NET introduces you to the ideas of REST and RESTful architecture, and includes a detailed discussion of how the Web/REST model plugs into the WCF architecture. If you develop with .NET, it's time to jump on the RESTful bandwagon. This book explains how. "While REST is simple, WCF is not. To really understand and exploit this part of WCF requires a knowledgeable and experienced guide.
